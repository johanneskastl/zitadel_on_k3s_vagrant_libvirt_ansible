# zitadel_on_k3s_vagrant_libvirt_ansible

Vagrant-libvirt setup that creates a VM with k3s and installs
[Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) into the cluster.

Default OS is openSUSE Leap 15.6, but that can be changed in the Vagrantfile.
Please be aware, that this might break the Ansible provisioning.

## Vagrant

1. You need `vagrant`, obviously. And `git`. And Ansible...
1. Fetch the box, per default this is `opensuse/Leap-15.6.x86_64`, using
   `vagrant box add opensuse/Leap-15.6.x86_64`.
1. Make sure the git submodules are fully working by issuing
   `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1. Run `vagrant up`
1. Run `kubectl --kubeconfig ansible/k3s-kubeconfig get nodes` and you should
   see your server.
1. Party!

## Cleaning up

The VMs can be torn down after playing around using `vagrant destroy`. This will
also remove the kubeconfig file `ansible/k3s-kubeconfig`.
